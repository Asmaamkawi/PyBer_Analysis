# PyBer_Analysis
PyBer is a Python ride sharing app company and they would like to perform an exploratory analysis to show case the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and rides as well as the percentage of the total fares, riders & drivers by the type of city. The analysis and visualizations that will be produced , will help PyBer improve access to ride sharing services and determine affordability for under served neighborhoods.

The data was in some very large CSV files and to aid the process we created a several types of visualizations to tell a compelling story about the data. We had to create python scripts through pandas library , Jupyter notebook and Matplotlib to create a variety of charts. From the data results it shows that the volume of rides is higher in the Urban city type with a lighter workload for drivers in the Suburban and Rural. Also it indicates that the average utilization of the ride sharing is of approximately 60% in the Urban, 25-30% in Suburban, and only 5-10% in Rural cities. this indicates that PyBer should promote to attract drivers to work in core urban city type in order to win a good market share vs their competitors .

the company should also invest in a good data flow software /tracking - end developed - in order to monitor gridding distribution of the drivers among areas to initiate those promotions live on the spot and be able to mobilize and deploy the drivers with the right numbers in the busy areas whenever needed .
